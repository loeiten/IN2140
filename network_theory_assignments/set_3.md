## Assignment 1

Briefly describe the difference between a component based and a recursive
network architecture.

### Answer assignment 1

- Component based
   - Each node has components with specialized responsibilities
   - There will be one component for routing, one for packet loss, one for
     encryption etc.
- Recursive
   - We split the network recursively into smaller and smaller part
   - Each part is responsible for transfer from one network to another
   - Each part does not care how it's smaller parts function
