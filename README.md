# IN2140

Learning the basics of OSes and networks from IN2140 held at UiO (without
actually taking the course)

The following is based on the 2019 version of the course (as newer courses are
behind a LDAP github-wall)

Many most programming assignments will only work on
[POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) compatible OSes
