# Assignment 1

## Assignment

If you want to use a function which is in the C standard library (for example
`strftime()`), how can you figure out what header file you have to include in
order to use the function?

## Solution

1. You could have a look at `SYNOPSIS` in `man strftime`
1. You could look it up at [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/chrono/strftime)
1. Several add-ons to IDE adds the header files automatically
