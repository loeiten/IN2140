# Assignment 1

## Assignment

Create Makefiles for set_1 and set_2

## Solution

Chose to use CMake as it is more portable and easier to also include the tests
with.
There are make files for both [shared](Makefile_shared) and
[static](Makefile_static) libraries for `s3_assignment_6`.
See [`CMakeLists.txt`](CMakeLists.txt) for how to call make files from CMake.
