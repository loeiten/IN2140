/*
 * Assignment:
 *
 * When using `malloc()` we need to free the memory when we're done with it.
 * Write a program which uses `malloc()` to allocate an area in the memory
 * before you fill it with text and write it out.
 * Finally the program should free the memory before terminating.
 * To test whether you have succeed use `valgrind` or `leaks`.
 * If you are successful you should get the following message
 *
 *    All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible
 *
 * or
 *
 *    0 leaks for 0 total leaked bytes
